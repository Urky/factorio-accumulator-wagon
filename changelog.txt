Version: 0.16.3
Date: 5. 1. 2019
  Changes:
    - No longer bump train mode for inactivity conditions by default since it causes unexpected behavior when stations are disabled while the train is stopped
    - New option added to re-enable this behavior for anyone who prefers to use inactivity conditions for their accumulator trains
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.2
Date: 19. 12. 2018
  Info:
    - Use item-with-entity-data instead of just item type
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 20. 10. 2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix inactivity conditions not working while empty
  Info:
    - Increase capacity of accumulator wagons by an order of magnitude so that each wagon is roughly enough power to mine a cargo wagon worth of ore with base productivity
    - Fluid in the wagons is now usable as energy storage - the wagons can be charged either through the electric network or by pumping battery fluid into them
    - Activate wagons when placed if appropriate instead of requiring the train to move
