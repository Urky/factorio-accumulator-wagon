  Info:
    - Increase capacity of accumulator wagons by an order of magnitude so that each wagon is roughly enough power to mine a cargo wagon worth of ore with base productivity
    - Fluid in the wagons is now usable as energy storage - the wagons can be charged either through the electric network or by pumping battery fluid into them
    - Activate wagons when placed if appropriate instead of requiring the train to move
